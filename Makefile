# This Makefile allows you to write your Javascript in separate files and then
# glue it together using the C preprocessor.
#
# (Makefiles use tab characters to introduce command lines.
# Make sure your editor preserves tabs when it saves Makefiles or it
# won't work.  See http://ax.to/make for more info on debugging Makefiles.)
#
# Source Javascript files end in .js.  These are built into a Javascript file
# with the suffix .jso ("Javascript object file") using this Makefile.  It's a
# bad idea to edit .jso files as your edits will be destroyed the next time
# "make" runs.
#
# To prevent issues with including the same file multiple times, each .js that's
# included by another needs to have #ifndef/#define/#endifs guards around it,
# just like in C or C++ headers.  Please see any of the .js files for examples.
#
# By convention, the top-level .js files, files that are never included by
# others, are only found in the js/ subdirectory, and all other files are found
# within the js/swirly/ subdirectory.  The .jso files all end up in the top
# directory, with any Max files.
#
# For best results, I recommend the following directory structure.
#
#   root/            # name this whatever you like.
#     some-project.maxpat
#     some-project.maxhelp
#     some-project.js       # I keep this as short as possible...
#     some-project.jso      # compiled JS
#     js/
#       swirly/             # all my JS
#       # more of JS code goes in here or a subdirectory.
#
# but you can just dump all your stuff in one directory and this Makefile should
# just work.

# -E means stop after preprocessing.
# -P means don't generate line markers (which confuse Javascript).
# -C means not to discard comments.
# -x c means treat the file as C code.
# -Wno-invalid-pp-token means not to complain about Javascript strings
#     using ' instead of ".
# -D_COMPILE_DATE="'`date`'" sets a preprocessor variable called _COMPILE_DATE
#     to be the current date and time.
