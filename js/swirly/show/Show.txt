The structure of a show

A "property mapper" wraps the funky Max For Live entities, fixes up their bogus
type issues, etc.  For example, given a track you can say track.get('level') and
receive a number representing the track's level (the naive method gets a string
which can't be used for calculation, but more, fails to work if you try to use
it to set that parameter!)

Show:
  input: a list of inputs
    [{name, help, callback, desc}, ...]

  live: the live environment
    tracks: A TrackDictionary by name.
      track: A property mapper (level, mute)

    liveSet: A property mapper (tempo, is_playing)

  lights: a dictionary mapping name -> lighting instrument
    instrument: A specific lighting instrument (i.e. laser_diffuse_2)
      definition: A general definition for that class of instruments.
      output: An output to that specific instrument (handles the channel offset).

  processors: A dictionary mapping name -> processor
    processor: A list of processor lines.
      line: A function that takes a control value and triggers an action.

  scenes: a dictionary mapping name -> scene
    scene: A function that is executed to trigger a scene.
           This function is usually a list of functions called subscenes.

    Subscenes have types: mic, vl70, program, lights, processor, tempo.
      mic, vl70:  names of audio channels.
      program: program change for vl70,
      lights:
